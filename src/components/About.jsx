    <h1>A Glimpse into My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      I&apos;m a 26-year-old soon-to-be university graduate with a passion for front-end programming. 
      From the moment I wrote my first line of HTML and CSS, I knew I had found my calling. 
      As I prepare to take my skills to the next level, I&apos;m excited to embark on this journey 
      of creating beautiful, user-friendly web experiences. I thrive on turning creative ideas 
      into functional, visually stunning websites that leave a lasting impression.
